## Day 1 - 2023.06.25

Distance: ~3 mi.

Time: N/A

Thoughts: It was my first day of running with actual running shoes (ASICS)
and I ran with my brother. It hurt like hell, and I could barely breath. It was
a spontaneous run, unplanned. Thus, I was quite dehydrated and for the majority
of the run, I felt light headed and over-heated. Moral of the story, stay
hydrated when running.

## Day 2 - 2023.06.26

Distance: 3.75 mi.

Time: 9:59 min/mi

Thoughts: I made sure to learn from my mistake yesterday and tried to drink a
lot of water to be hydrated for the run. I still felt thirsty but nothing as
bad as yesterday. About three quarters of the way through the run, I felt
discomfort in my right ankle and so I walked for about .3 of a mile before
running the rest of the way home. It was a good run. Taught me that it's okay
to walk throughout the run. Since I am not training to be an athlete or
anything, my main goal should be enjoyment. I am surprised that my body is
holding up well to the sudden milage. I'm considering to lower it tomorrow but
I don't know. Only tomorrow will tell.

## Day 3 - 2023.06.27

Distance: 3.13 mi.

Time: 10:00 min/mi

Thoughts: Today I did a morning run, which was something I haven't done in a 
while. I definitely prefer morning runs over afternoon runs, especially during
summer where the morning is much cooler than the afternoon. I didn't stop
mid-run today, but my legs and thighs are definitely sore since I haven't ran
for over two weeks and diving straight back into consecutive 5k is really
questionable.
