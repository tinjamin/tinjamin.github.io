This will be my third first post ever. That is to say that I have attempted to
start this "Rambunctious Living" blog three times. First time using Jekyll,
second time using Pelican, now, the third time, using my own custom
configuration. To start, I want to discuss why I was driven to create my own
configuration when there exists many markdown to html static site generator.
The answer is quite simple: I wanted to know the ins and outs of the system
without having to spend a lot of time reading documentation. To attain this
goal, I figured no better way to learn the ins and outs than to construct the
entire system myself. So that, I did. As you probably notice by now, the site
is very simple. Having very limited web development experience, I used only
HTML and CSS to construct this site (albeit there is a line of JS in there 
somewhere).

Another driving factor leading me to create my own configuration is the
realization that this blog will not be updated frequently, a new post coming out
(maybe) every 8-9 months. With such a long intermission period, systems like
Jekyll and Pelican would require quite some time to re-familiarize myself with
before I could start blogging. On the other hand, this custom configuration is
dependent on only 8 files:

1. about.html
2. archive.html
3. index.html
4. new-post.sh
5. blog-post.css
6. navbar.css
7. pages.css
8. blog-post-template.html

Hence, my hope is that by making the return to blogging easier after long periods
of not doing so, I could maintain this blog and keep it running unlike my first
two blog attempts.
