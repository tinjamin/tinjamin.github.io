			<h2>Day 1 - 2023.06.25</h2>
			
			<p>Distance: ~3 mi.</p>
			
			<p>Time: N/A</p>
			
			<p>Thoughts: It was my first day of running with actual running shoes (ASICS)
			and I ran with my brother. It hurt like hell, and I could barely breath. It was
			a spontaneous run, unplanned. Thus, I was quite dehydrated and for the majority
			of the run, I felt light headed and over-heated. Moral of the story, stay
			hydrated when running.</p>
			
			<h2>Day 2 - 2023.06.26</h2>
			
			<p>Distance: 3.75 mi.</p>
			
			<p>Time: 9:59 min/mi</p>
			
			<p>Thoughts: I made sure to learn from my mistake yesterday and tried to drink a
			lot of water to be hydrated for the run. I still felt thirsty but nothing as
			bad as yesterday. About three quarters of the way through the run, I felt
			discomfort in my right ankle and so I walked for about .3 of a mile before
			running the rest of the way home. It was a good run. Taught me that it's okay
			to walk throughout the run. Since I am not training to be an athlete or
			anything, my main goal should be enjoyment. I am surprised that my body is
			holding up well to the sudden milage. I'm considering to lower it tomorrow but
			I don't know. Only tomorrow will tell.</p>
			
			<h2>Day 3 - 2023.06.27</h2>
			
			<p>Distance: 3.13 mi.</p>
			
			<p>Time: 10:00 min/mi</p>
			
			<p>Thoughts: Today I did a morning run, which was something I haven't done in a 
			while. I definitely prefer morning runs over afternoon runs, especially during
			summer where the morning is much cooler than the afternoon. I didn't stop
			mid-run today, but my legs and thighs are definitely sore since I haven't ran
			for over two weeks and diving straight back into consecutive 5k is really
			questionable.</p>
			
			<h2>Day 4 - 2023.06.28</h2>
			
			<p>Distance: 3.13 mi.</p>
			
			<p>Time: 9:22 min/mi</p>
			
			<p>Thoughts: Hardest run yet. I started out way too fast, so then I ended up being
			exhausted towards the end. I walked multiple times throughout the run but
			managed to channel my inner dawg to run to the finish line. My feet and ankles
			feel horrendous though, so I might take it very easy tomorrow. I don't know.</p>
