			<p>This will be my third first post ever. That is to say that I have attempted to
			start this "Rambunctious Living" blog three times. First time using Jekyll,
			second time using Pelican, now, the third time, using my own custom
			configuration. To start, I want to discuss why I was driven to create my own
			configuration when there exists many markdown to html static site generator.
			The answer is quite simple: I wanted to know the ins and outs of the system
			without having to spend a lot of time reading documentation. To attain this
			goal, I figured no better way to learn the ins and outs than to construct the
			entire system myself. So that, I did. As you probably notice by now, the site
			is very simple. Having very limited web development experience, I used only
			HTML and CSS to construct this site (albeit there is a line of JS in there 
			somewhere).</p>
			
			<p>Another driving factor leading me to create my own configuration is the
			realization that this blog will not be updated frequently, a new post coming out
			(maybe) every 8-9 months. With such a long intermission period, systems like
			Jekyll and Pelican would require quite some time to re-familiarize myself with
			before I could start blogging. On the other hand, this custom configuration is
			dependent on only 8 files:</p>
			
			<ol>
                <li>about.html</li>
                <li>archive.html</li>
                <li>index.html</li>
                <li>new-post.sh</li>
                <li>blog-post.css</li>
                <li>navbar.css</li>
                <li>pages.css</li>
                <li>blog-post-template.html</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Hence, my hope is that by making the return to blogging easier after long periods
			of not doing so, I could maintain this blog and keep it running unlike my first
			two blog attempts.</p>
