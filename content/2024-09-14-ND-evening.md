Hey there! Its been a while. I just had the sudden rebellious urge to write
something. So here it is: sometimes, after working so hard, back to back days,
and getting very little done, you realize that work is always going to be 
there---so you have to choose.

Do you work? Or do you call it day?

The work is always going to be there, but the day is not. Time flows, day goes.
But work? Work always stays.

So take a break. You need it if you found yourself here.
