This post is a prolonged post, meaning that as I continue to progress through
the book, I will reflect, respond, and write about the book. The majority of
the questions that I will be answering can be found in the [study guide to "The
Four Loves" provided by the C.S. Lewis Foundation][1] (CLF). However, there will
be times where I will pose my own questions and ponderings, such will be most
noticeable due to the drastic decrease in sophistication. Without further
adieu, let the thoughts flow!

# Chapter 01 - Introduction

## Chapter Summary

## Question 01

> One Need-love, the greatest of all, either coincides with or at least makes a
> main ingredient in man's highest, healthiest, and most realistic spiritual
> condition... Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least 
> like God... This paradox staggered me when I first ran into it; it also
> wrecked all my previous attempts to write about love. 
<cite>"The Four Loves", C.S.Lewis</cite>

*Why might this paradox be so staggering? How does it subvert other assumptions
we make about Need-love?* ^CLF^

## Question 02

*How does Lewis distinguish between likeness to God and nearness to Him?* ^CLF^

## Question 03

> Where Need-love is felt there may be reasons for denying or totally
> mortifying it; but not to feel it is in general the mark of the cold egoist...
> the illusory feeling that it is good for us to be alone---is a bad spiritual
> symptom
<cite>"The Four Loves", C.S.Lewis</cite>
