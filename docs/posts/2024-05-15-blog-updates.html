        <p>Hey there! It has been quite a while… Nearly a year since my
        last post, and as I’m sure you can see, the blog has changed
        quite a bit. Indeed, the design has become simpler, and I did
        that on purpose. I found that managing the CSS of the previous
        version of the blog was a bit of a hassle. Moreover, being that
        this blog is my first fully self-designed/programmed blog, the
        previous version did not account for different screensizes…</p>
        <p>Put differently: I was (and still am) a noob and did not
        design my blog to be responsive. Thus, this time around while
        giving the blog a new look, I took the additional step of making
        it responsive. I am not quite sure how well it turned out, but I
        am sure that if it’s broken, I will find out soon enough.</p>
        <p>However, the majority of the time during this
        maintenance/upgrade was actually spent on the backend.
        Previously, the blog required python, python-markdown, npm, etc.
        to convert from markdown to html and generate the posts.
        Although a lot of the heavy lifting was done by the converting
        program, I still had to manually update the index every time I
        released a post, which was never…</p>
        <p>Now, however, thanks to pnutzh4x0r and the contributors of
        the NDlug blog project, I was able to transition to an entirely
        different system. This one requires only pandoc and a Makefile.
        If I am being completely honest, I have yet to fully understand
        the Makefile and the <code>build-index.sh</code> script that is
        used. That being said, the gist of the workflow is as
        follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Scan <code>content/*.md</code> for the markdown files</li>
        <li>Convert the markdown files to html using Pandoc and a post
        html template</li>
        <li>Feed the location of all the generated html files to
        <code>build-index.sh</code> which generates a linked bullet list
        to the files in html</li>
        <li>The html linked bullet list is inserted into the
        <code>index.html</code> template via sed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This fully automates the conversion from markdown to html
        along with updating the index. Hopefully, this new workflow will
        encourage me to post more because at this point, it is just
        typing in a markdown file, and I am not sure what else I can do
        to make this process more seamless :}</p>
