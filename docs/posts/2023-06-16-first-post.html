        <p>This will be my third first post ever. That is to say that I
        have attempted to start this “Rambunctious Living” blog three
        times. First time using Jekyll, second time using Pelican, now,
        the third time, using my own custom configuration. To start, I
        want to discuss why I was driven to create my own configuration
        when there exists many markdown to html static site generator.
        The answer is quite simple: I wanted to know the ins and outs of
        the system without having to spend a lot of time reading
        documentation. To attain this goal, I figured no better way to
        learn the ins and outs than to construct the entire system
        myself. So that, I did. As you probably notice by now, the site
        is very simple. Having very limited web development experience,
        I used only HTML and CSS to construct this site (albeit there is
        a line of JS in there somewhere).</p>
        <p>Another driving factor leading me to create my own
        configuration is the realization that this blog will not be
        updated frequently, a new post coming out (maybe) every 8-9
        months. With such a long intermission period, systems like
        Jekyll and Pelican would require quite some time to
        re-familiarize myself with before I could start blogging. On the
        other hand, this custom configuration is dependent on only 8
        files:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>about.html</li>
        <li>archive.html</li>
        <li>index.html</li>
        <li>new-post.sh</li>
        <li>blog-post.css</li>
        <li>navbar.css</li>
        <li>pages.css</li>
        <li>blog-post-template.html</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hence, my hope is that by making the return to blogging
        easier after long periods of not doing so, I could maintain this
        blog and keep it running unlike my first two blog attempts.</p>
