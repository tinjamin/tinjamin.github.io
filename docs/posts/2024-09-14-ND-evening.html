        <p>Hey there! Its been a while. I just had the sudden rebellious
        urge to write something. So here it is: sometimes, after working
        so hard, back to back days, and getting very little done, you
        realize that work is always going to be thereâ€”so you have to
        choose.</p>
        <p>Do you work? Or do you call it a day?</p>
        <p>The work is always going to be there, but the day is not.
        Time flows, day goes. But work? Work always stays.</p>
        <p>So take a break. You need it if you found yourself here.</p>
