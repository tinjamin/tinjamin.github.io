        <p>This post is a prolonged post, meaning that as I continue to
        progress through the book, I will reflect, respond, and write
        about the book. The majority of the questions that I will be
        answering can be found in the <a
        href="http://www.cslewis.org/resources/studyguides/Study%20Guide%20-%20The%20Four%20Loves.pdf?x71172">study
        guide to “The Four Loves” provided by the C.S. Lewis
        Foundation</a> (CLF). However, there will be times where I will
        pose my own questions and ponderings, such will be most
        noticeable due to the drastic decrease in sophistication.
        Without further adieu, let the thoughts flow!</p>

        <h2 id="question-01">Question 01</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>One Need-love, the greatest of all, either coincides with or
        at least makes a main ingredient in man’s highest, healthiest,
        and most realistic spiritual condition… Man approaches God most
        nearly when he is in one sense least like God… This paradox
        staggered me when I first ran into it; it also wrecked all my
        previous attempts to write about love. <cite>“The Four Loves”,
        C.S. Lewis</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><em>Why might this paradox be so staggering? How does it
        subvert other assumptions we make about Need-love?</em>
        <sup>CLF</sup></p>
        <h2 id="question-02">Question 02</h2>
        <p><em>How does Lewis distinguish between likeness to God and
        nearness to Him?</em> <sup>CLF</sup></p>
        <h2 id="question-03">Question 03</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Where Need-love is felt there may be reasons for denying or
        totally mortifying it; but not to feel it is in general the mark
        of the cold egoist… the illusory feeling that it is good for us
        to be alone—is a bad spiritual symptom <cite>“The Four Loves”,
        C.S. Lewis</cite></p>
